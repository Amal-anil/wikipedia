                                Combe Hill is a causewayed enclosure, near
                                Eastbourne in East Sussex, on the northern edge
                                of the South Downs. It consists of an inner
                                circuit of ditch and bank, incomplete where it
                                meets a steep slope on its north side, and the
                                remains of an outer circuit. Causewayed
                                enclosures were built in England from shortly
                                before 3700 BC until at least 3500 BC; their
                                purpose is not known. The enclosure has been
                                excavated twice: in 1949, by Reginald Musson;
                                and in 1962, by Veronica Seton-Williams, who
                                used it as a training opportunity for
                                volunteers. Charcoal fragments from Musson's dig
                                were later dated to between 3500 and 3300 BC.
                                Musson also found a large quantity of Ebbsfleet
                                ware pottery in one of the ditches.
                                Seton-Williams found three polished stone axes
                                deposited in another ditch, perhaps not long
                                after it had been dug. The site is only 800
                                metres (870 yd) from Butts Brow, another
                                Neolithic enclosure; both sites may have seen
                                Neolithic activity at the same time. (Full
